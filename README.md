This is a project by Katie Enns, Hunter Sayre, Javier Aguilar, and Pankaj Chaudhari

Our deliverable is a live-service python application that, utilizing Yelp’s API, will re-represent their data into a new / better user-interface that includes a geographical window with an accompanying window for filtering searches in the categories of ((City and Feature-Type), (and potentially more such as *Restaurant Theme*, *Stars / Rating*)), that as discussed so far / as a part of the GUI will enable and allow users to click and toggle the ‘displayed features’ of the map (restaurants, parks, etc) to see additional information about that feature.
