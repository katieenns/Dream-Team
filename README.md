This is a project by Katie Enns, Hunter Sayre, Javier Aguilar, and Pankaj Chaudhari

A web-based python application consuming Yelp’s API, will re-represent their data into a new / better user-interface that includes an interactive geographical window with an accompanying window for filtering searches in the categories of ((Active Life, Arts & Entertainment, Beauty and Leisure, Bicycles, Food & Drink, ~Health & Medical; aka Feature-Type), (and subcategories ~Rating,~Distance from Claremont Colleges / home)), that as discussed so far / as a part of the GUI will enable and allow users to click and toggle the ‘displayed features’ of the map (restaurants, parks, etc) to see additional information about that feature, including how far it is from the Claremont campus and if they accept Claremont Cash. 

Stakeholders include restaurants that are the restaurants displayed on the application as well as students at the Claremont Colleges
