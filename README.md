# YELP Search API Explorer

## Concept
A responsive web-based python application consuming Yelp’s search API, to re-represent their data into a new / better user-interface that includes an interactive geographical window with an accompanying window for filtering searches in the categories of ((Active Life, Arts & Entertainment, Beauty and Leisure, Bicycles, Food & Drink, ~Health & Medical; aka Feature-Type), (and subcategories ~Rating,~Distance from defined location)). The GUI will allow users to click and toggle the ‘displayed features’ of the map (restaurants, parks, etc) to see additional information about that feature, including how far it is from the user defined location.
